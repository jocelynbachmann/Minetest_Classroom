To test your biomes defined in settings.lua:
1. copy biomes.bmp and dem.bmp to the rasters root directory
2. create a new world with the realterrain mod enabled
3. change the settings as you desire and save
4. open the new world to see the results

If the preset biomes do not meet your needs you can replace them with whatever biome you want.
biomes-figure.jpg shows the preset biomes available out of the box.
